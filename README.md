# Crowdfunding_Excel
Repo for Module 1 Crowdfunding Analysis  

## Overview of Project
This project analyses 1,000 crowdfunding projects to reach conclusions on successful crowdfunding techniques.  

### Purpose  
The purpose of this project is to practice analysis and charting in excel.

### Analysis Questions  

1.  Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?
From this data we can conclude that Theater, Film & Video, and Music are the most popular and, generally, most successful types of crowdfunding campaigns.  Overall, the best time to launch a campaign is during June and July with a sharp decline in effectiveness in August.  Over three-quarters of all crowdfunding campaigns are launched in the United States.   

2.  What are some limitations of this dataset?
	This dataset does not indicate how long the successful campaigns took to reach fully funded.  This could help campaigns choose the most useful timeline.  Additionally, we have the campaign goal levels, but the data does not tell us what the profit margin is on the goal.  The profit margin would give campaigns direction on what levels are most successful.  The blurbs included with the data could be useful information, but they are not consistent so they cannot be grouped or filtered.  
  
3.  What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?
	A good crowdfunding campaign should be more than just successful.   The owners should be creating campaigns that will highly exceed their stated funding goal.  To find this, I would create a graph that looks at the average percent funded above 100 percent based on the category.   
	Many campaigns reward backers with increasingly better prizes at higher donation levels.  Organizing a campaign based on certain levels of donations could be useful.  I would also be interested in seeing what the average donation is for both the successful and the failed campaigns.  This would require the data to be converted to one currency for comparison purposes.  
	To better understand a campaign’s chances, it would be helpful to know the success rate for each category and by country.  To do this I would create a chart that calculates the percentage of successful campaigns from total campaigns and filter it by category and country.   


### Statistical Analysis  

	For the Successful and Unsuccessful datasets, the mean values summarize the data more meaningfully.  Both datasets have high variability in the number of backers and are skewed to the right.  If a campaign used the median values to see how many backers are required to be successful it would likely lead to an overestimation of their success.  They would assume too few backers are required.  
	There is higher variability with the successful campaigns.  This makes sense for a couple reasons.  First, the Canceled campaigns in the Unsuccessful group will likely have been canceled without reaching their full backing potential.  This allows less chance for outliers in the data.  Second, once campaigns become Successful they often gather additional backers because they are promoted more – they become viral.
